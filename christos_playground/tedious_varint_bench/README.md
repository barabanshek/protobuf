Initial benchmark on comparison between IAA and protobuf, but good

Does not compile with locally installed protobuf from git repo, yet

Should work with Makefile if protobuf is installed globally

Tested with libprotoc 3.20.0-rc1

Benchmark produces results in a .csv file

python script to generate plots --> soon
