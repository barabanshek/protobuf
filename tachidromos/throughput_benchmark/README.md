This directory will contain a benchmark stress testing the throughput capabilities of our system compared to traditional protobuf.
The main body of the benchmark is identical in both cases, as well as the .proto definition and the generated protobuf code. The only difference is that in one case we will use the functions generated by for the traditional protobuf serialization/deserialization, and in the other we will use the functions that we have integrated into protobuf in order to create the schema.
